# CNA FOR PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE SELECTION

The objective is to develop a python tool or app to assist policymakers in the selection of public infrastructure projects. Applying Complex Network Analysis concepts and measures we hope to provide new insights for the assessment of public transportation projects in terms of connectivity and centrality and novel ways to improve the economic impact of selected projects.

## Goal: assess and rank infrastructure projects according to their potential to improve:

- connectivity and centrality of transport and related networks
- capital assets leverage
- value to local economic activities
- efficiency and reduce costs

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

### Basic features: 

1. Calculate connectivity and centrality measures of public transport networks
2. Compare proposals according to these measures
3. Visualize topological data related to project proposals
